# Student Loans Analysis with Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning techniques to analyze and predict student loan outcomes. The goal is to build a model that can predict whether a student will default on their loan based on various features.

## Project Overview

- **File**: `student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: Predict student loan default using a neural network model.
- **Dataset**: Student loan dataset (specific details provided within the notebook).

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Steps

1. **Data Import and Exploration**
   - Load and inspect the dataset.
   - Understand the distribution and types of data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Scale numerical features.

3. **Model Building**
   - Define the neural network architecture.
   - Compile the model with appropriate loss function and metrics.

4. **Model Training**
   - Train the model using the training dataset.
   - Monitor training with validation data.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.
   - Analyze accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

6. **Prediction**
   - Make predictions using the trained model.
   - Interpret the results.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
3. Open `student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells sequentially to execute the analysis.

## Key Points

- **Metrics**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC.
- **Activation Functions**: Use appropriate activation functions for the output layer based on the nature of the prediction task.
- **Model Improvement**: Consider techniques like feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and advanced model architectures to improve model performance.
